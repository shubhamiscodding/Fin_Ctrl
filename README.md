## Problem Statment  ?

->Managing personal and event-based finances can be a daunting task, especially when it comes to tracking daily, weekly, or monthly expenses, allocating budgets for specific events, and maintaining financial transparency. Individuals often lack efficient tools to track and share financial data, while administrators face challenges in overseeing multiple users, managing permissions, and providing investment guidance.

This project aims to address these challenges by developing a comprehensive personal finance tracker web app that empowers public users to manage their finances effectively and enables administrators to control system-wide financial operations with ease.


->I am building a *personal finance tracker web app* designed for managing finances at the *daily, weekly, or monthly level. The app has two user types: **public users* and *admins*.  

### Key Features:
1. *User Roles*:  
   - *Public User*:  
     - Can track their own finances.  
     - Can share financial data publicly (optional).  
     - Can view shared profiles.  
     - Can add themselves to the system for finance tracking.  
   - *Admin*:  
     - Can view all users' finance trackers.  
     - Controls visibility of financial trackers (who can see what).  
     - Can invest on behalf of users.  
     - Can remove users from the system.  
     - Can promote users to admin or demote them.

2. *Finance Management*:  
   - Users can manage their finances for specific *events* manually.  
   - The system provides *money management guidance*.  

3. *Event Management*:  
   - Users can create and manage events (e.g., vacations, weddings, etc.) with allocated budgets.  

4. *Profile View*:  
   - Users can view other users' shared profiles (with admin-controlled visibility).  

### Functional Requirements:
- *User Addition*: Allow public users to self-register for finance tracking.  
- *Admin Privileges*: Admins can remove users, assign admin roles, and control profile visibility.  
- *Public Sharing*: Users decide whether to share their financial trackers publicly.  
- *Investments*: Admins can make investments on behalf of users.  

### Technical Considerations:
- Build with an intuitive *UI/UX* that is simple for users to navigate.  
- Ensure *data security* for sensitive financial information.  
- Implement role-based access control for admins and public users.
